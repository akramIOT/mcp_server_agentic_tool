# Enterprise MCP Server Developer Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The Enterprise MCP Server is built on a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of multiple services. The core components are:

### MCP Registry

The central component that manages the registration of services and their tools. It handles the routing of tool requests to the appropriate service implementation.

Key features:
- Service registration
- Tool registration
- Tool execution routing

### Service Implementations

Each service (GitHub, Linear, etc.) is implemented as a separate module that defines:
- Service metadata
- Tool definitions
- Tool implementations

### API Layer

A Flask-based REST API that exposes the MCP functionality to clients:
- Service discovery
- Tool discovery
- Tool execution

## Adding a New Service

To add a new service to the MCP server:

1. Create a new module in `src/services/`
2. Define the service implementation following the pattern in existing services
3. Register the service in `src/server/app.py`

Example:

```python
def initialize_jira_service() -> MCPService:
    jira_service = MCPService(
        type="jira",
        name="Jira",
        description="Jira issue tracking service",
        base_url="https://api.atlassian.com",
        api_key=os.environ.get("JIRA_API_KEY")
    )
    
    # Define and add tools...
    
    return jira_service
```

Then in `app.py`:

```python
def initialize_services():
    # Register existing services
    github_service = initialize_github_service()
    registry.register_service(github_service)
    
    linear_service = initialize_linear_service()
    registry.register_service(linear_service)
    
    # Register new service
    jira_service = initialize_jira_service()
    registry.register_service(jira_service)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Tool Routing Optimization

The MCP registry uses a direct name-based lookup for tools to maximize performance. This design choice was made to optimize for rapid tool execution in high-throughput environments.

```python
# Fast lookup by tool name
tool = self.tools_map[tool_name]
```

This approach is significantly faster than iterating through services and tools, especially as the number of registered tools grows.

### Service Registration Order

The order in which services are registered does not impact functionality but can influence performance. Services that are used more frequently should be registered first to optimize the common case.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

Each service handles its own authentication requirements. API keys are managed through environment variables.

### Tool Access Control

By design, all tools registered with the MCP server are accessible via the API. If you need to restrict access to certain tools, consider:

1. Implementing an authentication layer at the API level
2. Adding authorization checks in the tool implementation

### Service Isolation

Services are isolated in their own modules, but they share the same process space. Future enhancements may include service containerization for stronger isolation.

## Testing

The project includes test utilities in the `client` module:

```bash
# Run a simple agent demonstration
python src/client/agent_demo.py
```

This will exercise the API and verify that tools are correctly registered and executable.

## Deployment

The server can be deployed as a standalone service or as part of a larger application. For production deployments:

1. Set all required environment variables
2. Run behind a production-grade WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
3. Configure appropriate logging
4. Set `debug=False` in the Flask app

Example production startup:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 src.index:app
```
